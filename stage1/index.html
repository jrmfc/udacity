      HTML
    </div>
    <div class="section-content">
      <p> <em>HTML is <b>reasonably straightforward</b></em>.  It stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
        The text in html documents is much of the content visible via a web browser, while the markup formats how it looks.
      </p>

      <span class=samplespans>
        You can of course include images, like this picture of Homer the dog.<br>
        <img class=roundimage src="images/homer.png" alt="photo of Homer the dog"><br>
        And links to other pages like <a href="http://google.com">this</a>.
      </span>

      <p>Video and other content can be displayed and formatted using the various elements and tags of HTML.

   <p>You can use Google Chrome browser Developer Tools to explore the document object model, or structure of a web page.<br>
  You can review all the elements, adjust border and margin sizes, font size, text and background colors, and all sorts of style settings for your page.

     Boxes and more boxes
   </div>
   <div class="section-content">
    <p>By having all the elements and objects on a page living in a "box" of some sort, it becomes easier to work with boxes or groups of boxes to redesign how the page is laid out or how it looks.
When starting on a new page design, start from an overview of the "boxes" you see forming the page and work down to smaller boxes.  The content in each box can come later and be customized.

    <p>Use the div and span elements to group related content together.  By dividing your page with these elements, you create the boxes that allow for much faster and easier customization and changes of style for your content.

        CSS
      </div>
      <div class="section-content">
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) let you define page style throughout your project.  The benefit is not having to individually manage element text colors, pixel sizes, properties, etc, but to manage via a set of rules.
        The order of the rules matters, with the most specific rule being the one that matters most and takes effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        CSS is code you write to control style of your pages.  You can select an element like h1 or h2 for example, and apply a color or background color that applies evenly to every h1 or h2 element in your page.
      </p>

      <p>
        CSS can be included in the header of your page(s), inline with your elements, or linked to a seperate file. Inline or embedded in the head section is ok for very simple pages, but linking from a seperate file is best for larger projects.

      Divs and Spans
    </div>
    <div class="section-content">
      <p>
        Divs and spans seperate your text into manageable sections.  Divs create a rectangular box around sections of your page.
        <span class="samplespans">Spans surround text inline, without creating a box like a div.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can specify an id or a class with a div or span.  ID should be used for unique elements, while class should be for general sections that you want to be able to apply similar style across.

      Why Style?
    </div>
    <div class="section-content">
      <p>
        Poorly styled code may execute just fine on a computer.  However, reading and troubleshooting poorly styled code will probably be quite frustrating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Practicing good style lets you write more efficient, understand code more efficient, and help yourself and others communicate in a common method.
        Good style improves productivity for you and others that read your code or work with you on projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above all, remain consistent with your style.  Everyone who reads your code will appreciate that.

        Boxes are a little more complex than a 4 sided figure.  Each box has multiple parts  - margin, border, pattern, and content.
        Dealing with boxes can be challenging.  Here are some helpful reminders:
      </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Use percentages instead of pixels
          </li>
          <li>Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element in your css file.
          </li>
          <li>Refer to this <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">helpful page on flexbox</a>

  Getting it Done
  </div>
  <div class="section-content">
    <p>
      When working through your projects, code, test, and refine to get things done.  Start from
      larger things like boxifying content, then work your way into the details of content color, alignment, etc.
    </p>
    <p>Find natural boxes around the content.  Be aware of repeated elements and style like subject titles,
      sections of different or related content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, write your HTML.  Then apply your style from large to small elements.
      Fix things until you're happy with your page(s).
